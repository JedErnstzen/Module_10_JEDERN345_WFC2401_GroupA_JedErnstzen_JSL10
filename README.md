# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

You will:
1. Use the provided Starter Code Repository: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_10_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL10
2. Code your solution.
3. Commit changes to your GitHub repository.
4. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS [JSL10] Submission Project Tab.

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. You will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_10_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL10
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

#### Debugging Tasks

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**

## What You Need to Include:

1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

## How We'll Assess Your Work:

1. We will review your GitHub repository to ensure that it contains the updated code files.
2. We will assess the modifications made to the code to verify that they effectively meet the challenge requirements.
3. We will consider the commit history and meaningful commit messages to evaluate your coding process.
