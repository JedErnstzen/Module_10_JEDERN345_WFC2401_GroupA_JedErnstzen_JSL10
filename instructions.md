### Escape Vanilla JavaScript Challenge

### Project Overview

**Title:** Escape Vanilla JS Challenge

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project designed to test and enhance your understanding of Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. Participants will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

### Project Brief

#### Task Description

- **Room 1: The JSON Library:** Debug code related to fetching and displaying data from a JSON file.
- **Room 2: The Set Chamber:** Address issues in set operations to find the intersection of JavaScript and React concepts.
- **Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth:** Correctly implement asynchronous JavaScript to navigate through a series of steps.

### Code Logic
##### Room 1: The JSON Library

**Scenario:** You're in a library filled with books containing secrets to mastering JavaScript. To find the key to the next room, you must parse through a collection of JSON-encoded books to find the most recently published book on JavaScript.

**Logic:**

1. Fetch the list of books from an external JSON file named `books.json`.
2. Find the book with the most recent publication date.
3. Display the title of this book as the key to proceed.

##### Room 2: The Set Chamber

**Scenario:** You encounter a chamber with two magical sets representing essential JavaScript and React concepts. To unlock the door, you must find the intersection of these sets, symbolizing the shared knowledge required for both Vanilla JavaScript and React.

**Logic:**

1. Given two Sets of concepts, find the intersection.
2. Display the common concepts as the code to unlock the door.

##### Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth

**Scenario:** The final room challenges you to navigate through a labyrinth of asynchronous operations, a crucial skill for any React developer.

**Logic:**

1. Fetch a sequence of directions from an external JSON file named `directions.json`.
2. Apply these directions asynchronously to find your way through the labyrinth.
3. The correct path will lead you to the React world. Display an encouraging message upon success.

#### HTML Structure

The provided HTML template sets up a simple user interface for the challenge, including buttons for triggering each room's task and placeholders for displaying results.

#### Implementation Notes

- You should use the provided HTML and CSS files without modification.
- The JavaScript file, `escapeVanillaJS.js`, contains intentional bugs that you must correct to complete the challenge.
- Debugging involves understanding JavaScript promises, async/await syntax, set operations, and DOM manipulation.

#### Learning Outcomes

- Improved debugging skills in JavaScript.
- Enhanced understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, event handling, and working with sets.
- Greater familiarity with JavaScript's interaction with the DOM.
- Insight into the concept of abstraction in programming, demonstrated through the encapsulation of tasks and the separation of concerns in the challenge setup.
